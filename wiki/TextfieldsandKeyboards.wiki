#summary A walkthrough for the keyboard.

==Intro==

A walkthrough for using textfields and the keyboard, and how to get the screen to scroll up with the keyboard. Also get labels to show what was just typed.


===How To===

*1. Creating the textfield*<br>
First, open the viewcontroller.xib file in interface builder. Drag a textfield from the library into the view. Then open the viewcontroller.h file, and declare your textfield: type in {{{IBOutlet UITextField *textField;}}} (where "textField" is the name and can be anything you want,) after {{{UIViewController{}}}. Then, declare your accessors by typing {{{@property (nonatomic, retain) UITextField *textField;}}} after {{{ } }}}and before {{{@end}}}. Next, implement your accessors by going to the viewcontroller.m file and typing in {{{@synthesize textField;}}}. Finally, find the {{{-(void)dealloc}}} method and add {{{[textField release];}}} to it, above {{{[super dealloc];}}}.
<br> If you want to add the label, do the same thing, just change textfield to label, and {{{UITextField}}} to {{{UILabel}}}.
<br><br>
*2. Connecting it up in Interface Builder*<br>
Go back to viewcontroller.xib in interface builder. Right-click File's Owner, and look for the little circle next to textField, under Outlets. Click and drag that circle to the textfield you want in the view. It should now appear next to the circle, and if you hover over it, the selected textfield in the view should highlight. Do the same for the label if you have it.
<br><br>
*3. Recognizing when the keyboard will appear*<br>
First, we need to register to be notified by the {{{NSNotificationCenter}}} model class when the keyboard will show up. We do that by adding the following method to viewcontroller.m:<br><br>
{{{
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
   [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] 
      addObserver:self
      selector:@selector(keyboardWillShow:)
      name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification
      object:self.view.window];

   [super viewWillAppear:animated];
}
}}}
<br><br>
We also need to unregister when the view is released. We do this by adding the following method (right underneath the previous one, to keep things organized):
<br><br>
{{{
- (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
   [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]
      removeObserver:self
      name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification
      object:nil];

   [super viewWillDisappear:animated];
}
}}}
<br><br>
What we are doing when we write these methods is actually overriding the methods from the superclass. What we write is basically the same, we just added some code that will register us with NSNotificationCenter.

*4. Deciding when to scroll, and by how much*<br><br>
