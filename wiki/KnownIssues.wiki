#summary Issues that need fixing
===Total Points keep going up===
After you finish a quiz, say the total amount of points possible was 100, it will say that. But if you start another quiz, it will say 200 the second time, etc. I think it's adding the total points from all the quizes done(the points you actually got are only for the one quiz just finished)

===Crashes if you answer a question really quick===
Probably because you answered before the timer had a chance to update, but not sure on that.
