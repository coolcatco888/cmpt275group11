## Project Overview ##

The proposed project is an interactive fun-filled educational quiz game called **QuizMonkey** (working title) for the **iPhone** for students in Grades 2-3.  The goal of this project is to test the students’ spelling and grammar skills.  This software assumes that the student has already learned these skills and provides an assessment as to how refined their skills are.  Upon assessment the application will give them tips on how to improve their language skills as well as necessary corrections to the questions answered.


### Game Play ###

The game will quiz students on spelling, grammar and sentence structure.  Students will identify nouns and adjectives in sentences by tapping on the correct words displayed on the screen.

For each correct word, points will be added to the students’ score based on an internal marking scheme.  The score will then be uploaded to an external database server.  The teacher can then view the students’ progress by accessing the database’s website.

The interface will be simple and intuitive; on an actual iPhone the student will use the touch-screen.  The background can have a picture of a classroom with the questions displayed on the classroom chalk board.  Professor Monkey, the on-screen character will give instructions and hints to aid the student in using the program.

More features may be added if necessary to enhance the learning experience.
